# Remote Phonebook
Does allow you to create a special URL with an access tokken, where your phonebook can get access read only from remote.
This is useful for example to get your contacts into the phonebook of your local desk phone.
This is the basic module, you do need also a model specific module depending on the desk phone you are using.
